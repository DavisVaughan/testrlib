# `SOURCES_PKG` are the current project's c files. These are generally
# at the top level in the `src/` directory for R packages, but they can
# also have their own folder.

# `SOURCES_R_LIB` contains all of the files in `r-lib/` that need to be
# tracked by make. This list is something that would be copied into a package
# that is using the `r-lib/` library.

# We set the `all` target manually because otherwise the `clean` target
# will attempt to run when a simple `make` is called because it would be
# the first target in the file.

# The `clean` target is required, because by default R's mechanism will
# clean up only `.o` files in the top level directory. Without this, a
# check() will fail with a note about `.o` files in `r-lib/` existing.
